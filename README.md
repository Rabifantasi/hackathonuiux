My First Next.js Project: A Journey from Heart to Code ❤️
This project is a personal milestone for me—a creation built with all my heart and soul. For the first time, I feel truly connected to the code I’ve written. It’s far from perfect, but it’s mine, and every line reflects the excitement and determination I’ve poured into it.

What This Project Is About
It’s a Next.js application that I built as I explored the world of modern web development. From learning to navigate dynamic pages to figuring out how to deploy it, this project has been an incredible learning experience. While there are design flaws, I now know I can build a design from scratch—my way.

What Makes It Special
Custom Design, My Way: Everything you see, from the layout to the details, was thoughtfully created by me. It uses the Geist font, which gives it a clean, modern look.
Powered by Next.js: Leveraging features like fast refresh, server-side rendering, and static site generation, it’s built to perform.
Ready for the World: The app is fully deployable on Vercel, making it fast and reliable for anyone to experience.
Challenges I Overcame 🚀
This project taught me more than just coding. I faced challenges that tested my patience and determination:

Deployment Issues: My submission was delayed because I encountered errors during deployment on Vercel. Initially, these errors felt overwhelming, but I took the time to learn how to read deployment logs and understand what went wrong.
Debugging with Confidence: I can now confidently troubleshoot and resolve deployment issues—a skill I’m genuinely proud of.
Every mistake and obstacle taught me something valuable, helping me grow as a developer.

How You Can Try It
Start the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and take a look around.
Want to tweak it? Edit app/page.tsx, and watch your changes appear instantly.
What This Means to Me
This project is more than just a piece of software—it’s a reflection of growth, curiosity, and resilience. I’ve learned so much about design, debugging, and believing in my own abilities.
